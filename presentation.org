* What is compile-mode?

  Special mode for running compilations in Emacs!

  - streaming output
  - parse for links to files
  - keybindings for jumping between links / re-running the compilation

* But I don't Compile!

  Even if you don't compile your program, it is helpful!

  - running server processes
  - tailing logs
  - running tests

* Examples

 - grep-mode(s)
 - projectile
 - pytest.el / rspec-mode

* Let's try it out

 - [[file:pytest-example/foo.py][A simple python file]]
 - [[file:pytest-example/test_foo.py][A simple test]]

* Let's write something

 - [[file:tailer.el][tailer.el]]
* How it works

  - compilation-error-regexp-alist
  - [[file:example-compilation-regexp-alist-element.el][example]]
